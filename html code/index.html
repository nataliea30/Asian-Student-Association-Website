              On Lunar New Year, it is essential to drink <b>tea</b>! Aside from being delicious, tea is a symbol of good
              health and familiy ties. It is also said to bring about prosperity, abundance, and good health. <b>Tea ceremonies</b> are practiced
              between family and friends and symbolize a connection to offer respect and gratitude. Furthermore, we also have a <b>kumquat tree</b>!
              Like oranges, kumquats are a symbol of prosperity because they are always laden with fruits, and they are traditional gifts during Lunar New Year.

              On Lunar New Year, married people give <b>red envelopes</b> to children and unmarried relatives/friends.
              Why red?--Red symbolizes good luck and prosperity in Asian cultures, which is why our clothes and decorations are also in red. Red envelopes hold money inside, and represent tokens of 
              good fortune and prosperity for the year ahead. Inside my bag there are also <b>"yuan bao"</b> or good luck coins, that symbolize prosperity and wealth. Along with this, <b>fireworks and firecrackers</b> are essential to a loud and
              eventful celebration!

              On Lunar New Year, it is customary to buy/get <b>new clothes</b> before entering the new year. It symbolizes a new start
              and fresh hopes for the New Year, emphasizing change, new beginnings, and ridding of the old. The orange tree we have
              marks the start of the festival period, and <b>oranges</b> are said to promise luck, prosperity, and a new life. Lastly, it is
              tradition to cook a <b>great feast</b> for the New Year, with everyone participating in the cooking, and best of all--the eating!
